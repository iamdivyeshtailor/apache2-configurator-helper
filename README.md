# Apache2 Configurator Helper Script

## Overview

This Bash script automates the process of creating and managing virtual host configurations for Apache2. It helps you set up domain-based configuration, proxy pass setup, SSL certificate assignment via Certbot, and test your Apache configuration to ensure everything works correctly.

## Features

- Checks if Apache2 is installed and installs it if necessary.
- Greps the server IP and prompts you to point your domain to it.
- Creates an Apache virtual host configuration for your frontend or backend application.
- Configures a proxy for applications running on a specific port.
- Assigns an SSL certificate using Certbot (optional).
- Tests and validates the Apache configuration.
- Ensures that the site is enabled and linked to `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/`.

## Prerequisites

- **Ubuntu/Debian-based system**: The script is designed for systems with `apt` package management.
- **Apache2**: If Apache2 is not installed, the script will offer to install it.
- **Certbot**: If you wish to use SSL, Certbot is required. The script will offer to install Certbot if it's missing.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script directly:
